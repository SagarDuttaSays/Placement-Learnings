Rank() - this ranks the records in the order specified by ORDER command OVER the select column. When there is redundancy in values of the column, the next disimilar element will be ranked which is equal to rank of redundant elements + number of redundant elements.
Eg: 90  1
    91  2
    91  2
    91  2
    94  5 (2+3)
Syntax: select rank() over (order by col_name asc/desc) as 'alias' from table_name;

Dense_Rank() - this ranks the records in the order specified by ORDER command OVER the select column. When there is redundancy in values of the column, the next disimilar element will be ranked which is equal to rank of redundant elements + 1.
Eg: 90  1
    91  2
    91  2
    91  2
    94  3 (2+1)
Syntax: select dense_rank() over (order by col_name asc/desc) as 'alias' from table_name;

Row_Number() - used to assign a serial number to the newly customized rows.
Eg: 90  1
    91  2
    91  3
    91  4
    94  5
Syntax: select row_number() over (order by col_name asc/desc) as 'alias' from table_name;
