Leftmost Repeating Character is that first character from LHS whose frequency in the string is greater than 1. It does not have to be immediate next character in line.
    Example1:
    String input = "geeks for geeks"
    output = 0 (g is the first Left most character with freq >1)
    
    Example2:
    String input = "abbcc"
    output = 1 (b is the first Left most character with freq >1)
